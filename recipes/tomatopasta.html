        <h2>How to make Tomato Sauce Spaghetti</h2>
        <p>Now, the Italians are famous for being particular about their foods, and I am quite sure that many of them would think little of this particular pasta sauce recipe. I, however, think it is rather delicious, and I certainly hope that you do, too!</p>
        
        <p>This dish is the definition of a shortcut - most of the preparation process is taken care of for us thanks to the modern miracle of the <em>food processor!</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a large onion (or one medium onion [or two small onions {or three or more really very tiny onions}])</li>
            <li>A carrot</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>A 400ml can of chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp vegetable bouillon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roughly chop your onion, garlic and carrot, and add to the food processor. Blitz for ten or so seconds, until chopped up finely.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add vegetable mix, and fry gently until soft, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Once softened, add the canned tomatoes and bouillon. Stir to mix, and simmer gently for fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, then serve on a nest of delicious spaghetti.</li>
        </ol>
