        <h2>How to make Butter Soy Sauce Eringi</h2>
        <p>Nothing complements beer quite like buttery fried mushrooms. Well, that is not strictly true - in fact, there is one food item that complements beer even better: <strong>buttery soy sauce fried mushrooms!</strong></p>
        
        <p>This is another spectacularly simple recipe. All you need equipment-wise is a frying pan, and all you need refreshment wise is a glass of nice, cold beer.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g eringi (king oyster) mushrooms, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>Knob of butter, for frying</li>
            <li>A splash of good, Japanese soy sauce (Kikkoman or equivalent)</li>
            <li>Pepper to finish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt your butter in a small frying pan over a low heat.</li>
            <li>Once melted, add mushrooms. Stir occasionally to cook evenly.Mushrooms are miraculously hard to burn, so keep them cooking til they're nice and browned.</li>
            <li>Once nice and brown, finish by stirring through soy sauce and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve alongside an ice-cold glass of light lager beer.</li>
        </ol>
