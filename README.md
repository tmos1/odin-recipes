ODIN PROJECT - RECIPE WEBSITE PROJECT

2022-07-28
I will be using my fledgling html skills to create a simple recipe website.

Through this project, I hope that I will become more comfortable working with HTML
and git, and start to develop some semblance of an Efficient Workflow. 

This will be my first time working on a project using version control. I will try
and make sensible comments on my commits and generally not get myself in a tangle.

Will report back once I've battled through!
