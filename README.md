ODIN PROJECT - RECIPE WEBSITE PROJECT

2022-07-28

I will be using my fledgling html skills to create a simple recipe website.

Through this project, I hope that I will become more comfortable working with HTML
and git, and start to develop some semblance of an Efficient Workflow. 

This will be my first time working on a project using version control. I will try
and make sensible comments on my commits and generally not get myself in a tangle.

Will report back once I've battled through!


UPDATE 2022-07-28 A few hours later

I have managed to wrestle together a simple little recipe website! Was pleased to
be able to use the food photos I had languishing on my hard drive from a previous
punt at producing a food blog.

The process went quite smoothly. I think I can now say that, though clearly there is
an awful lot left to go, I have at least somewhat got my head around the very basic
basics at the entrance to the html rabbit hole. Let's see how wild it gets from here
on in!
